# Github repositories explorer

Simple application to explore GitHub users and their repositories.

To run the client application (after cloning it on your computer), in the project directory:

### `npm install`
will install all required dependencies, and

### `npm start`
will run the app in the development mode. It should open the browser and start automatically, but in case if something went wrong, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
